    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks. <br/> <br/> I love fish.
<br/><br/>The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
<br/>Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
<br/><br/>I like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
<br/>And sometimes I even go fishing.
<br/>And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
<br/><br/>Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
<br/><br/>I\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
<br/>You should ask someone else about fishing, though.<br/><br/>
